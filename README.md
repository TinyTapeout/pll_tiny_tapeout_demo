# Tiny PLL Tapeout

Super short and sweet tapeout. Two key blocks in here:

1. PLL "Controller" (really just phase and frequency detector)
2. Divider (/1 to /128, pow by 2)

Planning on implementing the rest on a breadboard!

## Pinout

**INPUT**
* `b0`:
* `b1`: Reference Clock In
* `b2`:
* `b3`: Divider Select[0]
* `b4`: Divider Select[1]
* `b5`: Divider Select[2]
* `b6`: Feedback Clock In
* `b7`:

**OUTPUT**
* `b0`
* `b1`: PLL "Up" Signal
* `b2`: PLL "Down" Signal
* `b3`: PLL Reset (for debug only)
* `b4`
* `b5`: Feedback Clock Out
* `b6`
* `b7`

# How to change the Wokwi project

Edit the [Makefile](Makefile) and change the WOKWI_PROJECT_ID to match your project.

# What is this about?

This repo is a template you can make a copy of for your own [ASIC](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/asic/) design using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).

When you edit the Makefile to choose a different ID, the [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/wokwi.yaml) will fetch the digital netlist of your design from Wokwi.

The design gets wrapped in some extra logic that builds a 'scan chain'. This is a way to put lots of designs onto one chip and still have access to them all. You can see [all of the technical details here](https://github.com/mattvenn/scan_wrapper).

After that, the action uses the open source ASIC tool called [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/) to build the files needed to fabricate an ASIC.

# What files get made?

When the action is complete, you can [click here](https://github.com/mattvenn/wokwi-verilog-gds-test/actions) to see the latest build of your design. You need to download the zip file and take a look at the contents:

* gds_render.svg - picture of your ASIC design
* gds.html - zoomable picture of your ASIC design
* runs/wokwi/reports/final_summary_report.csv  - CSV file with lots of details about the design
* runs/wokwi/reports/synthesis/1-synthesis.stat.rpt.strategy4 - list of the [standard cells](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/standardcell/) used by your design
* runs/wokwi/results/final/gds/user_module.gds - the final [GDS](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/gds2/) file needed to make your design
